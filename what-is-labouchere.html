    <h3>What is Labouchère?</h3>
    <p>
        Labouchère is a generic gambling system for trying to achieve a specific win goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labouch%C3%A8re_system" target="_blank">Labouchère</a>
        is also known as <i>Split Martingale</i> and the <i>Cancellation</i> betting system.
    </p>
    <h3>How is Labouchère used?</h3>
    <p>
        It can be applied to most gambling games that offer even money wagers. Some examples are
        Red/Black/Odd/Even/High/Low in Roulette. Also the Pass and Don't Pass bets in Craps, and
        the Player bet in Baccarat. You can also apply this to the Banker bet in Baccarat if the
        house doesn't take a commission.
    </p>
    <h3>State Your Goal</h3>
    <p>
        To implement Labouchère, you start by stating your goal in terms of units. Let's say you
        want to win 10 units.
    </p>
    <h3>Break up your Target Goal</h3>
    <p>
        Break apart your goal into smaller chunks. The most basic way to implement Labouchère is
        to make all single unit chunks. So a 10 unit goal would have 10 one-unit chunks. It's also
        to make your chunks 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    </p>
    <h3>Order your chunks</h3>
    <p>
        Now you want to put your chunks in to an ordered list. That's easy if each of the chunks
        are 1, but for most instances, the order will be a factor later.
    </p>
    <h3>Make your first bet</h3>
    <p>
        To calculate your next bet, add up the items at the top and the bottom of the list. If your
        list is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], then you'd bet 2 units (1+1). If your list is
        [1, 2, 3, 4], then you'd bet 5 units (1+4). If there is only one item in the list, then use
        that as your next bet.
    </p>
    <h3>Did you win or lose?</h3>
    <p>
        If you won, then cross the top and bottom items off the list and proceed to the next bet.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you lost, then add your current bet to the end of the list.
    </p>
    <h3>Is the list empty?</h3>
    <p>
        If you've crossed all the bets off the list, then you're done and you've achieved your goal!
        <b class="num-pos">Congratulations!</b> You're done!
    </p>
    <h3>Can you make the next bet?</h3>
    <p>
        If you don't have enough money to make the next bet, then you're done and your attempt was a
        <b class="num-neg">failure</b>.
